# Cloud Cost Guard

> A cloud cost observability dashboard that highlights daily spend trends, cost by service, top movers, and prioritized savings opportunities with evidence and methodology.

- Clear findings cards with evidence (resource, region, type)
- Simple CSV export of findings with savings

## Quickstart

```bash
# Node 20+ is recommended
npm install

# Start dev server (CRA)
npm start

# Production build
npm run build
```

### API
The frontend expects the following endpoints at `/api` (same-origin or via proxy):

- `GET /api/summary?window=7d|30d|90d`
- `GET /api/findings?sort=savings&limit=50`
- `GET /api/movers?window=7d`

If you're running a backend on a different port for local dev, add a CRA dev proxy in `package.json`:

```json
{ "proxy": "http://localhost:5000" }
```

Or, you can parameterize an API base via env (see **.env.example**).

## Cloud & Capital architecture
Cloud Cost Guard is a read-only dashboard that visualizes cloud financial signals produced by a small set of purpose-built Cloud & Capital tools. The dashboard itself does not fetch cloud data directly. Instead, it consumes a single normalized JSON document (`report.json`) generated by local CLI tooling. This keeps the UI decoupled from data collection, analysis, and modeling concerns.

## Data pipeline
The dashboard is powered by four tools, each with a narrow responsibility:
- **FinOps Lite** — AWS Cost Explorer CLI. Pulls account-level cloud cost data. Produces structured cost summaries (totals, trends, top services). Output is used as the cost baseline.
- **FinOps Watchdog** — CSV-driven anomaly detector. Identifies sustained spend spikes versus historical baselines. Emits machine-readable anomaly payloads with severity and deltas. Output is used for anomaly counts and “top movers.”
- **Recovery Economics** — Resilience and backup cost modeling CLI. Calculates monthly storage, restore, and total resilience cost per workload. Output is used for resilience cost visibility.
- **Cloud Capital Report** — Lightweight aggregator. Combines outputs from FinOps Lite, Watchdog, and Recovery Economics. Normalizes them into a single `report.json` schema. Acts as the contract between backend tooling and the dashboard.

## Unified report schema
Cloud Cost Guard reads only from `frontend/src/data/report.json`. The report includes:
- Cost baseline summary (from FinOps Lite)
- Anomaly metrics and recent anomalies (from Watchdog)
- Resilience cost totals and top workloads (from Recovery Economics)
- Window metadata and generation timestamp

Because the dashboard depends only on this schema, data sources can evolve without requiring UI changes.

## Local demo workflow
A typical local workflow looks like:
1. Run FinOps Lite to generate a cost overview JSON.
2. Run FinOps Watchdog on a local CSV to generate anomalies JSON.
3. Run Recovery Economics on a workload CSV to generate resilience JSON.
4. Run Cloud Capital Report to aggregate all three into `report.json`.
5. Start the Cloud Cost Guard frontend to visualize the results.

The `report.json` committed in this repository serves as a demo artifact. In a real deployment, it could be generated on a schedule or via CI.
